## About FunMaths
This is a Swift iOS application for iPhone. It allows the user to practice their maths operation. The user can practice either addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Once one of the operations is chosen the game along with a timer begins. The app will display a number to the user, and he/she will have a certain amount of time to pick one of four answers. Each answer shows an operation (the one chosen on the homepage) between two numbers. The user will need to select the correct operation which yields the number displayed to them. Selecting correctly will gain them one point and extra time, as opposed to a wrong answer which simply detracts one point. The user needs to score five points to win the game. At the end of the game three simple statistics will be shown to the user (points scored, correct answers, wrong answers). 

## How to run FunMaths
Simply clone the repository to your chosen directory. Then open it via XCode. Once opened select as a device simulator a 5.8 inch iPhone (i.e. iPhone X, Xs, 11 pro, etc.). Consequently press the play button and the app will run on the selected iPhone simulator and you will be able to interact with the app.
